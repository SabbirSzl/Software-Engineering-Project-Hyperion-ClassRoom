# Hyperion Classroom Software System
_Hyperion_ is a virtual platform which simplifies the interactions between students and teachers by creating a classroom environment. What distinguishes _Hyperion_ from other classroom software systems in the market is that it offers teachers the option to monitor students when performing their class activities.

Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the demand for online interaction platforms for students and teachers has grown. The need for a virtual platform that can substitute traditional classroom has inspired us to take this project. Software like Google Classroom already offer such platforms but, our aim is to offer what they lack and make life easier especially for teachers and invigilators by providing them with tools which will aid them in ensuring fair grading.
